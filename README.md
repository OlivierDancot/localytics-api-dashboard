PHP Dashboard for Localytics API using CURL

The Localytics documention is pretty weak, particularly for PHP. For a novice like me it was quite difficult to figure all this out. But hopefully this helps you get the most common metrics and also see how you can get specific EVENTS that you may track in your own instance of Localytics.

I include the php file in my dashboard and set the variables I want to output as TRUE (see the PHP file for details on this). Then you can do formatting, etc. on the page you include and output the metrics.

This is my first Github post because I thought it might be useful to people since there isn't much out there, barely anything on StackOverflow surprisingly. Please fork and contribute if you like.
